DLX
---

Files: dlx.c, dlx.h

`DLX`_ refers to the Dancing Links Algorithm for solving exact cover
matrix problems `described`__ by Donald Knuth.  The code in the ``dlx/``
subdirectory implements this generic algorithm, along with a few utility
functions to make constructing the interlocking linked lists easier.

Feature list
^^^^^^^^^^^^

* ``dlx_exact_cover`` finds an exact cover if one exists
* ``dlx_has_cover`` tries to see how many solutions exist, up to the
  provided max.  It does not actually return any solutions. 

Sudoku
------

`Sudoku`__ can be converted to an exact cover problem, and this is
exactly what the code in the ``sudoku/`` directory does.  The process is
described in detail in the header comments of ``sudoku.c``, as well as
by `Wikipedia's article on exact cover`__.

A driver program is provided in ``main.c``, and compiles into the
``ssudoku`` target.  Puzzles are read on standard input and solutions
are sent to standard output.  The representation used for input and
output Sudoku puzzles is a string of 81 characters, each one
representing a cell in the 9x9 sudoku grid, from left to right, top to
bottom.  Digits 1-9 are represented by the characters '1' - '9', and any
other character is treated as a blank.  Try ``ssudoku -h`` (currently an
invalid option) to get it to print out the usage help.

Feature list
^^^^^^^^^^^^

* ``sudoku_solve`` is the sudoku specific version of
  ``dlx_exact_cover``: it finds a solution if one exists and stops
* ``sudoku_nsolve`` is the sudoku specific version of ``dlx_has_cover``,
  except that it also returns a single solution on top of verifying the
  existence of other ones.

Matrix
------

This module is not really related to the rest of the project.  The code
``matrix.c`` provides a single function which takes an integer array of
only 0 and 1 and converts it to the 2D linked list format DLX uses.

A sample driver program with a hard-coded matrix is located ``test.c``.
It is the same example matrix used in _`Knuth's paper`.

Compiling
=========
::

    make ssudoku
    make test

There are two executable makefile targets.  The sudoku solver described
above in _`Sudoku` is ``ssudoku``, and the matrix test program described
in _`Matrix` is ``test``.
