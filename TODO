Ideas for future development.

Hint giving interface =====================

make sure puzzle has unique solution (hints don't make sense if solution
is non-unique)

compute unique solution and save order the cells are filled along with
constraint column id and number of candidates

any time user requests a hint, give the first cell the algorithm chose
that is not in the user's board

Far future

        * fill hint: ? (for laziness)

TODO: add file i/o interface or figure out how to make puzzle input less
annoying/time consuming

TODO: make board size configurable
