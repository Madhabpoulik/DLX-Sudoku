Ideas for future development.

Hint giving interface
=====================

make sure puzzle has unique solution (hints don't make sense if solution is
non-unique)

compute unique solution and save order the cells are filled along with
constraint column id and number of candidates

any time user requests a hint, give the first cell the algorithm chose that is
not in the user's board

TODO: add a next_hint function in sudoku.c

Far future
==========

curses interface: see curses.mockup.txt;

    TODO: finish designing the visual look
    TODO: add user message function to print stuff at the bottom
    TODO: check for unique solution, disable hints when solution is not unique

    * DONE

        * up, down, left, right: hjkl
        * 1 - 9 : 1-9
        * undo: u
        * undo all: c
        * erase cell: d, space
        * toggle fix givens: f
        * quit: q
        * solve board: s

    * TODO

        * refresh screen: ^L
        * display keys: ?
        * show/hide hint: h
        * fill hint: H (for lazy people and guess hints)
        * redo: r
